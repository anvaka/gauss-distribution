# Gaussian Distribution

I'm studying Machine Learning, was curious to learn more about Gaussian distribution...

Results [are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7ol3gy/gaussian_distribution_oc/).

The code is all in one file, and [I tried to document it](https://github.com/anvaka/gauss-distribution/blob/master/index.html).
Please do not hesitate to ask any questions if something isn't documented well enough.
